### The Problem

Challenges in managing flights during irregular operations and obtaining accurate data result in incorrect decisions and lost revenue. Too many tools that provide overlapping and sometimes conflicting information are causing unnecessary issues. This has lead to a growing loss of confidence and trust in the current application suite.

### Our Solution

* Implemented a phased implementation of ITIL, Agile and DevOps in order to stabilize the issue backlog;
* Conducted regular Design Thinking sessions to identify potential challenges and ideate on solutions;
* Developed a Daily Flight Operations Tool where dispatchers can manage flights from a single application with an emphasis on a streamlined User Experience;
* Implemented a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) process to facilitate faster feedback loops;
* Continuous investigation and working proof-of-concept projects with Next Generation Technologies.
