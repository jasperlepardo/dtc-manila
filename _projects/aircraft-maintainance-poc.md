<p class="lead">Project Background</p>
<p>Digital revolution adoption has been slow in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) operations. Recurring problems in component traceability and availability as well as maintenance scheduling remain major challenges that need to be optimized and addressed.</p>
<p class="lead">Business Challenge</p>
<p>How might we provide our customers with a solution that addresses existing business challenges in resource traceability, availability, and monitoring while at the same time leveraging technologies that ensure optimum security and efficiency?</p>
<p class="lead">Our Solution</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>We created a digital application that monitors the different aircraft maintenance records, as well as associated ordering and inventory functions to enable aircraft maintenance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>View different aircraft and its maintenance status</li>
    <li>View status of different aircraft components as it is ordered, shipped, and delivered</li>
    <li>View available aircraft components as part of the inventory system</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p class="lead">Why Blockchain?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blockchain can store aircraft maintenance records safely, enabling the exchange of information within a closed environment.</li>
    <li>Blockchain is less prone to record tampering, providing undisputable records during FAA audits or investigations.</li>
    <li>It provides visibility and transparency in the status and location of aircraft spare parts as it moves through the value chain.</li>
</ul>
